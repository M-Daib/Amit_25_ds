    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Functionality:**\n",
    "   - Implement a function `read_txt_file(file_path)` that reads the contents of a specified text file and returns it as a string. Ensure the function handles exceptions such as file not found or IO errors gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Class Structure:**\n",
    "   - Create a class named `UserExtractor` with the following:\n",
    "     - An `__init__` method that initializes the class with:\n",
    "       - `file_path`: The path to the text file.\n",
    "       - `usernames`: A dictionary to store usernames.\n",
    "     - A method `extract_usernames` that uses the `read_txt_file` function to read the contents of the text file and extracts usernames into a dictionary. \n",
    "       - Assume the format of each line in the file is `username:password`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assumptions:**\n",
    "   - Each line in the text file is formatted as `username:password`.\n",
    "   - Usernames should be unique in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling:**\n",
    "   - If there is an error in reading the file, ensure that the method returns an appropriate error message.\n"
